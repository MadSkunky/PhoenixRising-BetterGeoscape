This is astounding, given that the only noticeable resemblance to our species is the atrophied human body suspended from the creature's oversized limbs and carapace. 

Genetic origins: 70% homosapiens 

Function: intelligence remains undetermined. It's speculated that its goal is to spread the Third Mist Pandoravirus strain throughout the world

Offensive mutations: strong dispersal glands located on the creature's husk allow it to disperse biochemical droplets in a large area. Additionally the creature can squirt concentrated liquid through organs in its hands.

Mobility: the creature is fast and has the ability to jump at great distances

Weakness: the creature has been observed to adapt to any type of damage once dealt. It is recommended that attacks of various nature are used on it simultaneously before it can adjust.",,,,,,,,

The almost supernatural powers that the Acherons manifest in the field must result from their ability to somehow harness the Oneiric Delirium, and we suspect that they are a clue to gaining a further understanding of this phenomenon. Could it be that the Oneiric Delirium is not the result of an infection, but rather of some sort of signal?
 
Language: The specimen appears to retain some understanding of human speech, but is unable or unwilling to speak. Careful experimentation has shown that communications with other Pandorans take place via release of pheromones, which appear to convey instructions and information with uncanny precision. 

Countermeasures: tests have concluded that the Acheron becomes resistant to any type of weapon after receiving damage from it. The good news is that the creature's resistance doesn't improve further after that.",,,,,,,,

Just as speculated, it has proven possible to create ""super-soldiers"" using mutagens and the RDNA techniques developed by Barnabas in his research into the Oneiric Delirium treatment. We call them “Mutoids”. The newly created Mutoid soldiers are immune to the effects of the Oneiric Delirium and are capable of learning all human skills, and many of the Pandorans' as well (provided DNA samples are available). We have purposefully “advertised” that Mutoids are created entirely from Mutagens, but unfortunately the process does require a humanoid specimen with certain (though not uncommon) genetic markers. The procedure completely erases all memories and personality traits. We can easily procure suitable subjects in adequate numbers from friendly havens.

I am surprised. Of course I saw the possibilities myself but I thought this avenue of research crossed boundaries that should not be crossed. Perhaps I was wrong and it is time I addressed the biases that come with being a member of my species.

The plan is to corrupt a Spawnery with a modified strain of the Pandoravirus and use it as a Trojan Horse to modify the wavelength of the Pandoran signal, so that most humans would be cut off from it. All Pandorans are on the same network, so to speak; I presume as a security precaution - our Adversary must like its subjects on a tight leash. When a Spawnery is destroyed, a backup of its genetic banks is automatically ""uploaded"" to the network. Thus killing this Spawnery should infect the whole Pandoran psycho-neural network with the corrupted PV strain.

The Synedrion strike team I sent earlier succeeded at corrupting the Spawnery, but when they returned to destroy it, they were driven off.
