# PhoenixRising-BetterGeoscape
The primary aim of the mod is to reduce the amount of missions the player has to complete to beat the game while finishing all the DLC. It is expected that the player will not finish all the diplomacy missions, but will rather stick to one faction and acquire faction technology from the Blackmarket when necessary.

Requires playing with all 5 DLC on. (Living Weapons optional), preferably on Legend and with Better Classes mod.

What the Better Geoscape mod does at the moment:

Reduces amount of resource rewards granted in events to pre-Azathoth levels

Doubles the diplomacy attitude penalties in events

Caps Nests at 3 per playthrough, and increases the time necessary to build them (Legend only)

Caps Lairs at 3 per playthrough, and increases the time necessary to build them (Legend only)

Increases the time to build a Citadel (Legend only)

Removes all DLC5 KE missions; prices and items available as if all missions had been completed

Replaces all LOTA Schemata missions with KE2 mission (note: all storytelling elements pending)

Changes how corruption works (on by default, can be turned off in config):

Completely changes storytelling (corruption is now Oneiric Delirium, or simply Delirium)

Delirium starts on January 3rd; your operatives will gain 1 Delirium every time they carry a mission in an area covered by mist

Acherons will start appearing when aliens research Lair

Autopsing Acheron unlocks questline that will allow to create Mutoids, treat Delirium and eventually remove it completely.

To completely remove Delirium, now it is necessary to research Virophage weapons and Scylla Vivisection to unlock 3rd and final DLC mission.
