We have come up with a simple plan to obtain the NG+ Weapon Systems research without prejudicing our relations with New Jericho or drawing their attention to the value of the data in their possession. 

Your team will be inserted outside the operational perimeter and proceed to the objective on foot. After obtaining a copy of the data, they will steal an armored vehicle from the garrison and make their getaway in it. They will subsequently abandon and destroy the vehicle.

The viral mist is an extremely unusual phenomenon. It is in fact a highly complex aerosol, capable of moving with deliberation and transporting viral DNA and other microbes.

1) Symptoms never fully disappear, but are negligible when the subjects are fully rested, and progressively become worse as they exert themselves. 
2) Symptoms get worse if the subject stays or returns to locations where mist is present. 

We have termed this condition ""Oneiric Delirium"", on account of the subjects complaining of nightmares, or ""crazy dreams"", with similar themes of monstrosities and smothering.
