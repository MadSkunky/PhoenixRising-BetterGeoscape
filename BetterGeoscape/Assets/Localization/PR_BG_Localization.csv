The Pandorans grow ever more cunning and deliberate in their attacks. We need more and better weapons. West is right: whatever the wishful thinkers may be dreaming, any feasible solution to this menace requires force and the willingness to use it.",,,,,,,,

I wanted to thank you personally for delivering this information. It is crucial that all of us understand the peril we are facing. Over the years we have gathered a lot of evidence showing how the Anu cultists are collaborating with the enemy. In due time, they will pay for their crimes against humanity.",,,,,,,,

It has been reported that your organization is in the possession of an armored vehicle stolen from a New Jericho facility that came under heavy attack by Pandorans and unknown human or pseudo-human assailants. 

I'll be looking into this matter personally. 

West is showing great leniency to your organization in the expectation of the role it will play in the delivery of our species. For my part, sometimes I'm not so sure that we need you at all.",,,,,,,,

We have come up with a simple plan to obtain the NG+ Weapon Systems research without prejudicing our relations with New Jericho or drawing their attention to the value of the data in their possession. 

Your team will be inserted outside the operational perimeter and proceed to the objective on foot. After obtaining a copy of the data, they will steal an armored vehicle from the garrison and make their getaway in it. They will subsequently abandon and destroy the vehicle. We will present the facts to New Jericho as a raid by an unknown third party. As long as we can maintain plausible deniability, our relations with NJ should not be affected.",,,,,,,,

Vanadium Co had an R & D division, Next Generation+ Weapon Systems, focused on designing armaments that required as of yet undiscovered technologies, energy sources or materials with impossible tensile strengths or conductivity. 

Though at the time it was deemed little more than a publicity stunt and part of Vanadium's talent retention strategy, we speculate that these weapons could be indeed developed using the materials harnessed by the Ancients.

We have located a New Jericho archive facility harboring the NG+ Weapon Systems research.",,,,,,,,

The viral mist is an extremely unusual phenomenon. It is in fact a highly complex aerosol, capable of moving with deliberation and transporting viral DNA and other microbes.

It is our belief that the vast waves of mist that helped cause the destruction of civilization were generated underwater by gigantic, mutated structures. Each wave, including the current one (referred to by the population as the Third Mist) has slightly different properties.",,,,,,,,
SDI1_OUTCOME,Text,,"We have received reports of a variety of afflictions suffered by individuals who have traveled or reside in areas covered by the mist: tiredness, lack of energy, brain fog, anguish and sometimes hallucinations.

So far we can conclude the following:

1) Symptoms never fully disappear, but are negligible when the subjects are fully rested, and progressively become worse as they exert themselves. 
2) Symptoms get worse if the subject stays or returns to locations where mist is present. 

We have termed this condition ""Oneiric Delirium"", on account of the subjects complaining of nightmares, or ""crazy dreams"", with similar themes of monstrosities and smothering.
